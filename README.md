# LastLib

Experimental Modelica library for tool-generic FMU import to determine the online-minimum of a transient variable.
It was first presented at the 17th meeting of the Modelica Usersâ€™ Group Saxony.

## Library description

LastLib consists of tool-specific Modelica wrappers for the imported Last.fmu to obtain the value of the _last_ valid simulation step.

An overview of the library and early experiments are provided in

### Supported Modelica tools

* Dymola (both Linux and Windows)
* OpenModelica (with C runtime)
* SimulationX

### Example

The primary use-case of LastLib is the calculation of the online-minimum.
The provided example model `MinimumTest.Test` demonstrates the usage of the `LastLib` within the minimum block `MinimumTest.Minimum`.
